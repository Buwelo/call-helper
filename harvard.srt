00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,600
The stale smell of old beer lingers.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,180
It takes heat to bring out the odor.

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,340
A cold dip restores health and zest.

00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,060
A salt pickle tastes fine with ham.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,340
Tacos al pastor are my favorite.

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,500
A zestful food is the hot cross bun.
