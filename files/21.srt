00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,420
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Once upon a time, there were four little

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,980
rabbits, and their names were Fopsie, Mopsie, Cottontail,

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:08,560
and Peter.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,620
They lived with their mother in a sandbank,

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,000
underneath the root of a very big fir

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,280
tree.

7
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:18,880
Now, my dears, said old Mrs. Rabbit one

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,460
morning, you may go into the fields or

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,380
down the lane, but don't go into Mr.

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,140
McGregor's garden.

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,860
Your father had an accident there, he was

12
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,420
put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,560
Now, run along, and don't get into mischief,

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,760
I'm going out.

15
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,320
Then, old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,760
her umbrella to the baker's.

17
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,480
She brought a loaf of brown bread and

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,740
five currant buns.

19
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,380
Fopsie, Mopsie, and Cottontail, who were good little

20
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,740
bunnies, went down to the lane to gather

21
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,340
blackberries.

22
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,520
But Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,340
away to Mr. McGregor's garden and squeezed under

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:56,680
the gate.

25
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,960
First, he ate some lettuces and some French

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,880
beans, and then he ate some radishes.

27
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,400
And then, feeling rather sick, he went to

28
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,980
look for some parsley.

29
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,400
But, around the end of a cucumber frame,

30
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,040
whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor?

31
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,360
Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees,

32
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,900
planting out young cabbages.

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,460
But he jumped up and ran after Peter,

34
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,320
waving a rake and calling out, Stop thief!

35
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,860
Peter was most dreadfully frightened.

36
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,800
He rushed all over the garden, for he

37
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,260
had forgotten the way back to the gate.

38
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,240
He lost one of his shoes among the

39
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,940
cabbages and the other shoe amongst the potatoes.

40
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,320
After losing them, he ran on four legs

41
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,800
and went faster, so that he might have

42
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,000
got away altogether if he had not unfortunately

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,200
ran into a gooseberry net caught by the

44
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,440
large buttons on his jacket.

45
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,000
It was a blue jacket with brass buttons,

46
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:54,740
quite new.

47
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,000
Peter gave himself up for lost, shed big

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,720
tears, but his solids were overheard by some

49
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,940
friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great

50
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,560
excitement and implored him to exert himself.

51
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,919
Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve, which

52
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,380
he intended to pop upon the top of

53
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:11,600
Peter.

54
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,420
But Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving

55
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,180
his jacket behind him, and rushed into the

56
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,780
tool shed and jumped into a can.

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,740
It would have been a beautiful thing to

58
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,180
hide in if it had not had so

59
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,460
much water in it.

60
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,120
Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was

61
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,440
somewhere in the tool shed, perhaps hidden underneath

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,060
a flower pot.

63
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,020
He began to turn them over carefully, looking

64
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,540
under each.

65
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,500
Presently, Peter sneezed.

66
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,660
Curty shoe!

67
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,720
Mr. McGregor was after him in no time,

68
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,540
and tried to put his foot upon Peter,

69
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,840
who jumped out of a window, upsetting three

70
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,220
plants.

71
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,900
The window was too small for Mr. McGregor,

72
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,960
and he was tired of running around after

73
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,180
Peter.

74
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,400
He went back to his work.

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,960
Peter sat down to rest.

76
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,180
He was out of breath and trembling with

77
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,180
fright, and he had not the least idea

78
00:02:59,180 --> 00:02:59,900
which way to go.

79
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,920
Also, he was very damp, with sitting in

80
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,320
that can.

81
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,520
As your time you began to wander about,

82
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,200
going lippity-lippity, not very fast, and looking

83
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,720
all around.
