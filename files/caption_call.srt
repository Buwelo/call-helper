1
00:00:01,921 --> 00:00:03,103
Being
invisible is

2
00:00:03,183 --> 00:00:04,906
my
superpower. I

3
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:06,609
don't mean
that I am a

4
00:00:06,669 --> 00:00:08,272
superhero who
is out

5
00:00:08,793 --> 00:00:09,895
slattering
villains,

6
00:00:10,316 --> 00:00:12,239
cape flapping
in the wind as I

7
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,221
boom over the
New York

8
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:15,164
skyline. The
truth is,

9
00:00:15,204 --> 00:00:17,708
instead, that
I am a woman of a

10
00:00:17,909 --> 00:00:19,351
setting age
who has

11
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:20,493
suddenly
morphed into

12
00:00:20,513 --> 00:00:22,296
invisibility.
But don't

13
00:00:22,336 --> 00:00:23,994
worry. This
isn't going to

14
00:00:24,034 --> 00:00:25,517
be a poor me
story written

15
00:00:25,577 --> 00:00:26,338
about a
middle-aged

16
00:00:26,398 --> 00:00:28,421
woman longing
for her past.

17
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:29,603
That would
accomplish

18
00:00:29,683 --> 00:00:31,887
nothing. And I
am a person who

19
00:00:31,947 --> 00:00:34,03
gets things
done. I am used

20
00:00:34,07 --> 00:00:36,093
to being the
one everyone

21
00:00:36,173 --> 00:00:38,237
turns to for
answers and

22
00:00:38,677 --> 00:00:39,899
the one who
pretended

23
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,201
that I wasn't
aware of the

24
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:43,793
power that my
looks had as I

25
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:44,935
coaxed people
to do things

26
00:00:44,976 --> 00:00:46,158
for me. As
you're

27
00:00:46,178 --> 00:00:49,165
reading this,
I know that I

28
00:00:49,245 --> 00:00:50,187
probably
sound like a

29
00:00:50,227 --> 00:00:51,83
narcissist,
or perhaps

30
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:54,336
just a bit
shallow. I am

31
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:55,338
neither of
those things.

32
00:00:55,498 --> 00:00:57,021
I am a realist,
and I'm

33
00:00:57,081 --> 00:00:58,043
skilled at
getting the

34
00:00:58,104 --> 00:00:59,707
results I need
for any given

35
00:00:59,747 --> 00:01:02,084
situation. I
am the queen of

36
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:03,606
manipulating
or

37
00:01:03,826 --> 00:01:05,588
influencing
people. It's

38
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:06,809
one of the
hazards of my

39
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:08,752
job. I am
responsible

40
00:01:08,812 --> 00:01:09,933
for keeping my
department

41
00:01:09,993 --> 00:01:11,475
afloat
financially,

42
00:01:11,635 --> 00:01:12,736
which has not
come by

43
00:01:12,776 --> 00:01:14,238
easily, or
without

44
00:01:14,298 --> 00:01:15,099
learning to
pressure

45
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:16,22
people into
making quick

46
00:01:16,28 --> 00:01:17,902
decisions
that make them

47
00:01:17,982 --> 00:01:19,404
uncomfortable.
Not my

48
00:01:19,484 --> 00:01:21,366
problem, as
regret

49
00:01:21,406 --> 00:01:25,605
accomplishes
nothing. You

50
00:01:25,646 --> 00:01:27,469
wouldn't know
any of this

51
00:01:27,55 --> 00:01:28,933
about me,
though if you

52
00:01:28,993 --> 00:01:29,995
happen to
notice me

53
00:01:30,075 --> 00:01:31,378
today,
sitting in

54
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,34
this
nondescript

55
00:01:32,38 --> 00:01:36,268
coffee shop, I
am here

56
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:37,511
because it's
across the

57
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:38,413
street from
the hospital

58
00:01:38,453 --> 00:01:40,528
where I work.
so I can work in

59
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,75
peace as I
finish this

60
00:01:41,81 --> 00:01:43,252
grant
proposal. And

61
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:44,354
now I have this
power of

62
00:01:44,434 --> 00:01:45,856
invisibility.
No one

63
00:01:45,896 --> 00:01:47,158
disturbs me
while I work,

64
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:49,041
which is good
because I need

65
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:50,302
to submit this
proposal by

66
00:01:50,382 --> 00:01:51,845
tomorrow to
secure our

67
00:01:51,885 --> 00:01:53,407
next round of
funding. If

68
00:01:53,507 --> 00:01:54,428
approved,
this grant

69
00:01:54,468 --> 00:01:55,43
will bring in
millions of

70
00:01:55,51 --> 00:01:57,072
dollars and
allow people

71
00:01:57,132 --> 00:01:58,214
to keep their
jobs for the

72
00:01:58,254 --> 00:02:00,136
next year. So
it's a big deal

73
00:02:00,176 --> 00:02:01,298
and I strive
under

74
00:02:01,378 --> 00:02:03,76
pressure. If
you notice me

75
00:02:03,82 --> 00:02:05,103
though, you
might assume

76
00:02:05,143 --> 00:02:08,108
I'm just
someone's mom

77
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:09,65
getting out of
the house

78
00:02:09,75 --> 00:02:11,473
because I'm
lonely now

79
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:12,735
that my kids
have moved

80
00:02:12,776 --> 00:02:15,039
out. You might
imagine that I

81
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:16,402
have a husband
who has lost

82
00:02:16,482 --> 00:02:18,185
interest in me
as you take

83
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:19,627
note of my
thickening

84
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:21,31
waistline,
hair speckled

85
00:02:21,35 --> 00:02:23,373
with gray, and
smile lines

86
00:02:23,454 --> 00:02:24,375
that only my
husband

87
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:25,497
thinks are
charming.

88
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:26,714
Neither of
those

89
00:02:26,794 --> 00:02:27,596
assumptions
would be

90
00:02:27,676 --> 00:02:29,319
completely
wrong. I do

91
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:31,162
miss my kids. I
might be a

92
00:02:31,222 --> 00:02:32,584
little
lonely. I

93
00:02:32,644 --> 00:02:36,21
might not, but
I'm not submit

94
00:02:36,25 --> 00:02:37,853
bored
housewife as

95
00:02:37,913 --> 00:02:38,975
far as my
husband goes.

96
00:02:39,476 --> 00:02:40,638
I'm not sure
how Dave feels

97
00:02:40,678 --> 00:02:42,26
about me these
daze. We're

98
00:02:42,32 --> 00:02:43,743
both so be easy
with our jobs

99
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,165
that I don't
think either

100
00:02:45,225 --> 00:02:46,528
of us takes the
time to notice

101
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:48,03
the other. We
get along

102
00:02:48,13 --> 00:02:49,192
vine. That's
not the

103
00:02:49,232 --> 00:02:49,813
problem.
