00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,320  
Hello Mark D'Angry, how are you today?  

2  
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,780  
Hey Brad, long day, huh?  

3  
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,540  
How's the weather?  

4  
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,300  
It’s okay, you know, just windy.  

5  
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,940  
Cold and stormy.  

6  
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,280  
Yeah, a little chilly here too, in Atlantic.  

7  
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,080  
It’s about 64 degrees.  

8  
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,600  
Wow, that’s warmer than here.  

9  
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,980  
It's, like, 12 degrees here in Salt Water City.  

10  
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,520  
That's... freezing.  

11  
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,360  
Right.  

12  
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,040  
No snow, just ice.  

13  
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,659  
Are you doing any swimming?  

14  
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:32,620  
No snow? That’s odd.  

15  
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,960  
I was going to ask if you're doing any   

16  
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,340  
skiing.  

17  
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,140  
No, no skiing.  

18  
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,620  
Just staying warm, you know.  

19  
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,540  
That’s fair.  

20  
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,440  
The kids are doing well, what are they even  

21  
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,100  
into these days?  

22  
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,240  
They started playing racquetball, I think?  

23  
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,720  
Or was it rugby... one of those.  

24  
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,580  
Oh, wow.  

25  
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,320  
Didn’t know racquetball was big in Utah.  

26  
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,780  
A little, the kids just play what their friends play.  

27  
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,519  
It's more peer pressure than interest.  

28  
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,440  
Got it.  

29  
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,880  
Here in Atlantic, soccer is what kids play.  

30  
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,100  
Oh, wow.  

31  
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,500  
In Utah, soccer is a winter game.  

32  
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,940  
Yeah, it starts in spring here.  

33  
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,620  
They’re gearing up.  

34  
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,500  
Right, gearing up.  

35  
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,080  
Nice.  

36  
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,620  
Who do you want in the Super Bowl?  

37  
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,340  
Uh... Rams? I think?  

38  
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,700  
That’s a choice.  

39  
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,380  
Rams could do it.  

40  
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,560  
I’d hope so.  

41  
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,280  
Right.  

42  
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:49,780  
I don't know most games, just those two.  

43  
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,040  
As long as Patrick Mahoney isn’t in, I’m good.  

44  
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,940  
Who do they play?  

45  
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,950  
Uh, Baltimore?  

46  
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,389  
Is it?  

47  
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:08,930  
That sounds right.  

48  
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,390  
Yeah, Baltimore.  

49  
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,150  
And the Eagles... who are they against?  

50  
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,500  
I don’t know.  

51  
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,800  
Houston? Detroit?  

52  
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,030  
Texas? Chiefs?  

53  
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,490  
The Rams?  

54  
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,190  
The Eagles got Rams, and Baltimore has Buffalo.  

55  
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,970  
Right, Chiefs versus Texans.  

56  
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,030  
Anyway, just wanted to check in.  

57  
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,650  
Yeah, all good here.  

58  
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,490  
Alright.  

59  
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,190  
Chat next week, yeah?  

60  
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,330  
Sounds good.
