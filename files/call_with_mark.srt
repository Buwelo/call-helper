00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,320
Hello Mark D'Angola, how are you today?

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,780
Hey Brian, it's been a long time.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,540
How's it going?

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,300
It's going okay, you know.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,940
It's a little cold over here.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,280
Yeah, it's a little cold here too in Atlanta.

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,080
It's about 46 degrees.

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,600
Well, that's warm from where I'm at.

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,980
It's like 26 degrees here in Salt Lake City.

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,520
Wow, that's cold.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,360
Right?

12
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,040
And no snow, just cold.

13
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,659
Are you doing any snow?

14
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:32,620
No snow, that's good.

15
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,960
I was going to ask you if you're doing any

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,340
skiing.

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,140
No, no skiing.

18
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,620
Just trying to stay warm.

19
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,540
That's good.

20
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,440
The kids are doing good, so what are they up

21
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,100
to these days?

22
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,240
You know, they're deciding to play rugby, so they started

23
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,720
rugby practice this week.

24
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,580
Oh, wow.

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,320
I didn't realize rugby was popular in Utah.

26
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,780
A little bit, especially with the kids my kids hang

27
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,160
out with.

28
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,519
So, I think it's more of a pure thing than

29
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,040
it is a passion thing.

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,440
Gotcha.

31
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,880
Here in Atlanta, they're playing soccer, so soccer is what's

32
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,600
big right now.

33
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,100
Oh, wow.

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,500
Over here in Utah, soccer is like a fall sport

35
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,360
and a spring sport.

36
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,940
Yeah, soccer starts spring here.

37
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,620
Right, so they're gearing up.

38
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,500
They're gearing up.

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,080
Nice.

40
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,620
Who do you like this weekend in football?

41
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,340
I'm hoping the Rams and the Lions.

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,700
That's a good pick.

43
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,380
I'm hoping the Rams go.

44
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,560
I'm with you.

45
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,280
Right.

46
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:49,780
I don't know too much of the other games, but

47
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,480
those are the two that I've chosen to cheer for

48
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,280
the rest of the way.

49
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,040
As long as Patrick Mahomes doesn't go, I'll be happy.

50
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,940
Who do they play this round?

51
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,950
They are playing, is it Baltimore?

52
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,389
Where are they playing?

53
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:08,930
That sounds right.

54
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,210
Is it Baltimore?

55
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,390
Yeah, I think it's Baltimore.

56
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,150
Yeah, because the Eagles, and I'm trying to think who

57
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,270
they're playing, there's the other.

58
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,500
I just, I don't know.

59
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,100
Yeah, I just had it up too.

60
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,800
Washington, Detroit.

61
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,030
Houston, Kansas City.

62
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,490
Oh, the Rams.

63
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,190
The Eagles play the Rams, and Baltimore, Buffalo.

64
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,970
Yeah, Chiefs play the Texans.

65
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,030
Anyway, I just figured I'd call and catch up.

66
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,110
Glad to hear everybody's doing good.

67
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,650
Everybody's doing great.

68
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,490
All right.

69
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,190
We'll chat next week and talk to you later.

70
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,330
Sounds good.
