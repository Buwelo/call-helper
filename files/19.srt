1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,860
Being invincible is my superpower

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,480
I don't mean that I am a superhero who

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,480
is out slattering feelings, cape flapping in the wind

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,480
as I zoom over the New York skyline

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,360
The truth is instead that I am a who man

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,420
of a certain age who has suddenly morphed into

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,200
invisibility.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,280
But don't worry, this isn't going to be a

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,620
poor me story write in about a middle-aged woman

10
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,300
longing for her past.

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,520
That wood accomplish nothing, and I am a person

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,780
who gets things dan.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,280
I am used to being the one everyone turns

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,000
to for answers, and the one who pretended that

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,020
I wasn't aware of the power that my looks

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,080
had as I coaxed people to do things for

17
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,320
me:

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,780
As you're reading this, I know that you're probably

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,700
that I probably sound like a narcissist or per harps

20
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,280
just a bit shallow.

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,200
I am neither of those things.

22
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm a helix, and I'm skilled at getting the

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,120
results I need for any given situation.

24
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,760
I am the queen of manipulating or influencing people.

25
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,100
It's one of the hazards of my job.

26
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,160
I am responsible for keeping my department afloat financially,

27
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,460
which has not calm buy easily, or without learning

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,640
to pressure people into making quick decisions that make

29
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,340
them uncomfortable.

30
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,800
Not my problem.

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,240
As regret accomplishes nothing.

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,620
You wouldn't gnaw any of this about me, though

33
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,360
if you happen to notice me today sitting in

34
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,990
this nondescript coffee shop, I am here because it's

35
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,910
across the street from the hospital where I work

36
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,490
so I can work in peace as I finish

37
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,250
this grant proposal, and now I have this power

38
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:44,630
of in feasibility.

39
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,990
No one disturbs me while I work, which is

40
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,270
good because I need to submit this proposal by

41
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,730
tomorrow to secure our next round of funding.

42
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,430
If approved, this grant will bring in billions of

43
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,090
dollars and allow people to keep their jobs for

44
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:58,670
the next year.

45
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,210
So it's a big deal, and I drive under

46
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:01,630
pressure.

47
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,110
If you notice me though, you might assume I'm

48
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,990
just someone's mom getting out of the house because

49
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,090
I'm lonely now that my kids have moved out.

50
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,850
You my imagine that I have a husband who

51
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,410
has lost interest in me as you take note

52
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,530
of my thickening waistline, hair speckled with grey, and

53
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,070
smile lines that only my husband thinks are charming.

54
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,410
Neither of those assumptions would be completely wrong.

55
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,010
I do miss my kiss.

56
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,770
I might be a little lonely.

57
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:37,150
I might not, but I'm not some bored housewife

58
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,910
as far as my husband goes.

59
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,150
I'm not sure how day feels about me these

60
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:41,510
days.

61
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,390
We're both so busy with our jobs that I

62
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,170
don't think either of us takes the time to

63
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:46,830
notice the other.

64
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,310
We get along fine.

65
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,530
That's not the problem.
