1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,170
Out in the garden Mary sat hemming a

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,890
pocket and there came a little insect

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,690
running, oh, in such a hurry, across the

4
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,190
small stone table by her side.

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,730
The sewing was done, for Mary liked doing

6
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,230
nothing best, and she thought it would be

7
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,970
fun to drop her thimble over the little

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:18,270
ant.

9
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,450
Now he is in the dark, said she,

10
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,670
keep in mind he is only such a

11
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:23,630
little.

12
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,330
Mary ran away, for her mother called her,

13
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,670
and she forgot all about the ant under

14
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,270
the thimble.

15
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,110
There he was, running round and round and

16
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,250
round the dark prison, with little horns on

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,390
his head, quivering, little perfect legs bending as

18
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,430
beautifully as those of a racehorse, and he

19
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,530
was in quite as big a fright as

20
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,510
if he were an elephant.

21
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,550
Oh, you would have heard him say, if

22
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,270
you had been clever enough, I can't get

23
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,090
out, I can't get out, I shall lie

24
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:53,970
down and die.

25
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,330
Mary went to bed, and in the night

26
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,110
the rain poured, the handkerchief was soaked as

27
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,690
if somebody had been crying very much.

28
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,590
When she went out to fetch it as

29
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,010
soon as the sun shone, she remembered who

30
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,010
was under the thimble.

31
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,350
I wonder what he is doing, said Mary,

32
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,070
but when she lifted up the thimble, the

33
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,170
little tiny thing lay stiff and still.

34
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,610
Oh, did he die of being under the

35
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,490
thimble, said she aloud, I am afraid he

36
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,110
did mine.

37
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,210
Why did you do that, Mary, said her

38
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,730
father, who was close by and who had

39
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:25,610
guessed the truth.

40
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,770
See, he moved one of his legs.

41
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,530
Run to the house and fetch a wee

42
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,910
taste of honey from the breakfast table for

43
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,210
the little thing you starved.

44
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,970
I didn't mean to, said Mary.

45
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,030
She touched the honey in the spoon.
